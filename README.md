## Installation

```sh
npm i buycoins-js-sdk
```

### Authentication

To authenticate API requests, you need to generate your keys by going to the API Settings screen on BuyCoins.

Two keys will be generated:
Public Key: Think of this as a username. It"s how BuyCoins knows which user is attempting to make a request. Secret Key:
Think of this as a password. BuyCoins never stores your Secret Key, we only generate it and display it you ONCE. Copy &
keep your secret key in a secure place (e.g Environment Variables).


To apply, please send an email to support@buycoins.africa from your email account registered on BuyCoins

## Quick Start

```js

import { Buycoins } from "buycoins-js-sdk"

// Pass in the public and secret key when creating a new instance.
// Your pulic key is also your username while your secret key is your password
const buycoins = new Buycoins("public key", "secret key")

buycoins.wallet.createPaymentAddress({ crypto: "bitcoin" }).then(
  res => {
    console.log(res)
  }
).catch(
  err => {
    console.log(err)
  }
)

```

# Usage

## Wallet
## Create Address

To receive cryptocurrency, you will first have to create an address on BuyCoins then send this address to the sender.

```js
buycoins.wallet.createPaymentAddress({ crypto: "bitcoin" }).then(
  res => {
    console.log(res)
  }
)
```

Sample Response

```json
  "data": {
    "createAddress": {
        "cryptocurrency": "bitcoin",
        "address": "3KYsTqVKMFuucVubShhvvjfUWCEzLQF816",
      },
  }
```


## Confirmation

Confirmations required for supported cryptocurrencies before your account is credited with sent transactions:

Bitcoin: 1

Ethereum: 20

Litecoin: 12

NairaToken: 1


## Wallet Balances

You can view your balance(s) at any time by calling the getWalletBalance method. This will return all your balances or the
balance of a particular cryptocurrency argument passed in.

```js
buycoins.wallet.getWalletBalance().then(
  res => {
    console.log(res)
  }
)
```

Returns a sample response  :

```json
"data":{
    "getBalances":
          [
    {
      "id": "QWNjb3VudC0=",
      "cryptocurrency": "usd_tether",
      "confirmedBalance": "0.0",
    },
    {
      "id": "QWNjb3VudC0=",
      "cryptocurrency": "naira_token",
      "confirmedBalance": "1000.0",
    },
    {
      "id": "QWNjb3VudC0=",
      "cryptocurrency": "bitcoin",
      "confirmedBalance": "0.0",
    },
    {
      "id": "QWNjb3VudC0=",
      "cryptocurrency": "ethereum",
      "confirmedBalance": "0.0",
    },
    {
      "id": "QWNjb3VudC0=",
      "cryptocurrency": "litecoin",
      "confirmedBalance": "0.0",
    },
    {
      "id": "QWNjb3VudC0=",
      "cryptocurrency": "usd_coin",
      "confirmedBalance": "0.0",
    },
  ],
}
,
```

Sample request to get the balance of a particular currency

buycoins.wallet.getWalletBalance({ crypto: "naira_token" }).then(
  res => {
    console.log(res)
  }
)
```

Returns a sample response  :

"data":{
  "getBalances":
  [
    {
      "id": "QWNjb3VudC0=",
      "cryptocurrency": "naira_token",
      "confirmedBalance": "1000.0",
    },
  ],
}
```

# Sending

## Network fee

How to get estimated network fees before sending

This will show you how much you"re likely to be charged in network fees to send cryptocurrency to an external address

```js
buycoins.send.getNetworkFee({ crypto: "bitcoin", amount: 0.01 }).then(
  res => {

  }
)
```

Sample Response

```json
"data":{
  "getEstimatedNetworkFee": {
    "estimatedFee": "0.0004",
      "total":"0.0104",
  },
}
```

## Send

This allows you to send cryptocurrency to an on-chain address. Remember to call Network Fees to calculate how much total
will be removed from your cryptocurrency account balance.

```js

buycoins.send.send({
  address: "uuurkrkmckmdmcmwkopu8e9w8",
  amount: 0.01,
  crypto: "bitcoin",
}).then(
  res => {
    console.log(res)
  }
).catch(
  err => {
    console.log(err)
  }
)
```

Sample Response for Error

```json
"message":"Not enough Bitcoin in your main account",
  "locations":[
  {
    "line": 2,
    "column": 3,
  },
  ],
  "path":[
  "send",
  ],
```

This allows you to send cryptocurrency to an off-chain address using their buycoins username.

```js
buycoins.send.sendOffChain({
  recipient: "henadad",
  amount: 0.01,
  crypto: "bitcoin",
}).then(
  res => {
    console.log(res)
  }
).catch(
  err => {
    console.log(err)
  }
)
```

# Buy and Selling
A primer on buying and selling cryptocurrency with the BuyCoins API

There are two ways to buy or sell cryptocurrency using the BuyCoins API.
1. Peer-to-peer trading
2. Buying from and selling to BuyCoins directly.


Peer-to-peer (P2P) trading
P2P trading allows you to trade cryptocurrency with other users by posting limit orders or [market orders](#)

Pros
 * You can specify the exact price at which you want to buy or sell a cryptocurrency.

Cons

* Limit orders may take a while to be fulfilled because there might not be a user that wants to engage your order at your specified price for a while.


Buying and Selling to BuyCoins

You can buy from and sell to BuyCoins by placing buy and sell orders.

Pros 
* Your order is fulfilled near-instantly.

Crons
* You are unable to specify a price at which you want to buy/sell a cryptocurrency.



# Buy

To buy, you will first need to get an active price and then proceed to use this price to place an order. The getPrices
method allows you to do this. You can also pass an optional cryptocurrency argument to view singular cryptocurrency
prices.

To place a buy order, you will need the id of an active price

Buy orders usually get filled in a minute but not more than 5 minutes. To check the status of your order, you can do a
node lookup on Order using the id returned in your buy order mutation.

```js
buycoins.order.buy({
  price: "QnV5Y29pbnNQcmljZS0zOGIwYTg1Yi1jNjA1LTRhZjAtOWQ1My01ODk1MGVkMjUyYmQ",
  coin_amount: 0.1,
  crypto: "bitcoin"
}).then(
  res => {
    console.log(res)
  }
)
```

## Sell

To sell, you will first need to get an active price and then proceed to use this price to place an order. The getPrices
method allows you to do this. You can also pass an optional cryptocurrency argument to view singular cryptocurrency
prices.

To place a sell order, you will need the id of an active price.

Sell orders usually get filled in a minute but not more than 5 minutes. To check the status of your sell order, you can
do a node lookup on Order using the id returned in your buy order mutation.

```js
buycoins.order.sell({
  price: "QnV5Y29pbnNQcmljZS0zOGIwYTg1Yi1jNjA1LTRhZjAtOWQ1My01ODk1MGVkMjUyYmQ",
  coin_amount: 0.1,
  crypto: "bitcoin"
}).then(
  res => {
    console.log(res)
  }
)
```


## Webhook
When certain events occur, BuyCoins will make a POST request to an endpoint of your choosing (HTTPS only) with relevant information in the request body.
To update your Webhook URL, go to the API Settings screen on BuyCoins. Whenever you update your Webhook URL, a Webhook Token will be generated. 


### Verification
To be able to verify that requests to your Webhook URL are coming from BuyCoins and not a malicious actor:

```js
buycoins.webhook.validateSignature('signature','body', 'token').then(
  res => {
    
  }
)
```

Responding to a Webhook Request

You should respond to an event with a 200 OK. We consider this an acknowledgement by your application.
If your application responds with any status outside of the 2xx range, we will consider it unacknowledged and thus, continue to send it every hour for 3 hours.
You don't need to send a request body or some other parameter as it would be discarded - we only pay attention to the status code.
